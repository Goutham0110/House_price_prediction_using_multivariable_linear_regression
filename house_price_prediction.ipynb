This model uses 5 variables to predict a single value. Since this is not a showcase but an implementation of multivariable linear regression to predict the price of a house with the attributes area, bedroom, bathroom, stories and parking. Using of test_train_split can reduce the accuracy of the mode so we decided not to use it. This program will take the attributes as input and predict the price of the house."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"2Ed4JHqxbG59"},"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","from sklearn import linear_model as L\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","\n","#uploading dataset\n","from google.colab import files\n","uploaded=files.upload()\n","\n","#importing dataset\n","df=pd.read_csv(\"Housing.csv\")\n","df.corr()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"3dgtw7V4bwbz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1622836038724,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":331,"user":{"displayName":"GOUTHAM S","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ggc7IVmfyXC-4yg5N94KW7msVJssUyVeWcgscvL=s64","userId":"01070671359836502402"}},"outputId":"45ccd779-a8db-4ca7-a327-974351300805"},"source":["#Linear regression model\n","X=df[['area', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'stories','parking']]\n","Y=df[['price']]\n","lm=L.LinearRegression()\n","lm.fit(X,Y)"],"execution_count":34,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["LinearRegression(copy_X=True, fit_intercept=True, n_jobs=None, normalize=False)"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":34}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ZqhlkFPub6BO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1622839932484,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":8373,"user":{"displayName":"GOUTHAM S","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ggc7IVmfyXC-4yg5N94KW7msVJssUyVeWcgscvL=s64","userId":"01070671359836502402"}},"outputId":"340c4155-3ae8-4653-a529-23518d8e7d94"},"source":["#price prediction\n","itr=['area', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'stories','parking']\n","lst=[]\n","for _ in itr:\n","  lst.append(int(input(\"Enter \"+_+'\\t')))\n","yhat=lm.predict([lst])\n","if (yhat<0):\n","  print(\"\\n\\nThe given data doesn't seem to be right\")\n","else:\n","  print(\"\\n\\nPredicted price of the house is \",round(float(yhat),ndigits=2))"],"execution_count":54,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Enter area\t0\n","Enter bedrooms\t0\n","Enter bathrooms\t0\n","Enter stories\t0\n","Enter parking\t0\n","\n","\n","The given data doesn't seem to be right\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
